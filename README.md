Designed and built from scratch as my first major project on my path to becoming a web developer. This website was a means to build and display the skills I am learning and projects I have completed on my way to becoming a Frontend developer.

This website was designed in Figma and built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaSript. I had originally hosted it through Github Pages but have since migrated it to use Netlify hosting.

The website can be viewed live here: https://shaonbd.netlify.app/
